﻿// ARITHMETIC OPERATORS

// While programming we'll often find ourselves needing to run calculations, both simple and complex
// In C# we have 5 main mathematical operators you'll see

// Start out with a few different variables, here we have two different integers
// While we're keeping it simple, you may want to mention that names like a and b are not advisable
int a = 22;
int b = 15;

// Addition: +
// Earlier we talked about declaration and initialization. Another term to add is assignment
// Any time we want to assign a value to a variable, we complete the statements on the right side first
// We then assign the final value to the variable on the left side of the assignment operator (=)
int sum = a + b;
Console.WriteLine(sum);

// Subtraction: -
int difference = a - b;
Console.WriteLine(difference);

// Multiplication: *
int product = a * b;
Console.WriteLine(product);

// Division: /
int quotient = a / b; //-- With whole numbers it drops any remainder/decimal
Console.WriteLine(quotient);

// Remainder: %
// This is also know as modulus
int remainder = a % b; //-- Returns only the remainder of the operation
Console.WriteLine(remainder);


// Another example for using operators is with DateTimes
DateTime now = DateTime.Now;
DateTime someDay = new DateTime(1978, 1, 1);

// Here we can take two different DateTime instances and calculate a TimeSpan
// Obviously you can'y just do this with any types in C#
TimeSpan timeSpan = now - someDay; //-- Again we see the subtraction operator being used
Console.WriteLine(timeSpan);


// COMPARISON OPERATORS

//-- Comparison, or Relation Operators, compare their operands (the bits on the left and right of the operator)

// Often in C# we will want to be able to compare different objects
// We have another set of Operators we can use for this

// Let's start with some variables to use when comparing values
int age = 25;
string username = "Joshua";

// Checking if something is equal to something else can be done with two equal signs (==) in C#
bool equals = age == 41;
bool userIsAdam = username == "Adam";
Console.WriteLine("User is 41: " + equals);
Console.WriteLine("User is Adam: " + userIsAdam);

// Checking inequality in C# is done with the Bang operator (!) followed by an equal sign
bool notEqual = age != 112; //-- Bang operator
bool userIsNotJustin = username != "Justin";
Console.WriteLine($"User is not 112: {notEqual}");
Console.WriteLine($"User is not Justin: {userIsNotJustin}");

// A slightly harder concept to grasp is equality with reference types
// In C#, because we're dealing with computers, we have to consider how the memory works
// NOTE: Now would be a good time to discuss Stack vs Heap (value vs reference etc)
// We can see a difference between value and reference types by creating and comparing a couple reference types
List<string> firstList = new List<string>();
firstList.Add(username);

List<string> secondList = new List<string>();
secondList.Add(username);

// Now we have two lists that both contain the same string
// It is best to breakpoint this and show the values
// But even so, what happens if we compare the two?
bool listsAreEqual = firstList == secondList;
Console.WriteLine($"The lists are the same: {listsAreEqual}");
// Because the references are different, they are not equal
// They do not share the same memory reference (pointer)


// Moving on to other comparisons we have:
// Greater than
bool greaterThan = age > 12;

// Greater than or Equal to
bool greaterThanOrEqual = age >= 24;

// Less than
bool lessThan = age < 66;

// Less than or Equal to
bool lessThanOrEqual = age <= 24;

// We can start to add complexity to our comparisons by checking multiple comparisons with OR and AND
// OR comparison
bool orValue = equals || lessThan;

bool trueValue = true;
bool falseValue = false;

bool tOrT = trueValue || trueValue;
bool tOrF = trueValue || falseValue;
bool fOrT = falseValue || trueValue;
bool fOrF = falseValue || falseValue;
Console.WriteLine($"True or True: {tOrT}");
Console.WriteLine($"True or False: {tOrF}");
Console.WriteLine($"False or True: {fOrT}");
Console.WriteLine($"False or False: {fOrF}");

// AND comparison
bool andValue = greaterThan && orValue;

bool tAndT = trueValue && trueValue;
bool tAndF = trueValue && falseValue;
bool fAndT = falseValue && trueValue;
bool fAndF = falseValue && falseValue;
Console.WriteLine($"True and True: {tAndT}");
Console.WriteLine($"True and False: {tAndF}");
Console.WriteLine($"False and True: {fAndT}");
Console.WriteLine($"False and False: {fAndF}");
